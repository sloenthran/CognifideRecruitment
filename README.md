## Application framework
SwaggerUI - for automatic generation of documentation

SpringBoot

Gradle

## Testing framework
jUnit4

Mockito

RestAssured

## Design Patterns
Singleton - to the Library class because you do not need to load a list of books to memory from Google API every time

Builder - to the Book class because the number of parameters needed to create it would be unreadable in the default constructor
